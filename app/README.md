# FriendFinder

## Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

For this project, I have built a compatibility-based “FriendFinder” application – basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users’ surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I am utilizing Node & Express to handle the routing. My front end is built with some CSS styling and Bootstrap Framework. This application is hosted on a Heroku server in turn effective creating my own API. Enjoy the application!

Friend Finder is deployed to Heroku: https://peaceful-meadow-23721.herokuapp.com/
